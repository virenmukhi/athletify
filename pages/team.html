        <h3>"At that moment came the birth of Athletify, we just didn't know it yet."</h3>
        <p>I have dedicated my entire life to the world of sport and fitness. After graduating from university I represented Yuk Fai (div 1 HKBA) throughout my early adulthood. My passions for both the game and physical fitness drew me into the professions of coaching and training. In 2007, I was introduced to Glen Yang whom at the time was just an 11-year old kid discovering his love for the game of basketball. Several years later - after persistent training and belief - Glen signed his first professional contract with South China Athletic Association Basketball (SCAA). <br> <br> Within that moment came the realization of what could be achieved on a much grander scale. At that moment came the birth of Athletify, we just didn't know it yet. </p>

        <h3>"The game has blessed me in so many ways"</h3>
        <p>I started playing basketball when I was 10 years old and since then I have committed my whole life to the game. I moved to Canada in 2012 to pursue my basketball career at a higher level and to compete against a higher level of competition. I played AAU basketball in Maryland in the United States for the summer of 2012 and played against some of the top high school players on the east coast. In 2014, I accepted a Basketball scholarship to Mount Royal University which competes in the highest Canadian college/university level - The Usports/CIS League. I will leave the school being the All-Time Leader in Points, Assists, Steals, and Games Started and Games Played for MRU. Since 2016, I've been playing professionally for SCAA Basketball Club in Hong Kong during the summer time. <br> <br> This game has blessed me in so many ways, one of them being the start of Athletify. We're going to grow the game of basketball, one player at a time.  </p>

        <h3>"What we're trying to do is something special for the youths!"</h3>
        <p>I've been playing professional basketball for the past 5 years. Up until my first year playing in Hong Kong I never really had a personal skills coach whom I worked with day and night, I kind of learned the game by myself. I met Lap & Glen in my first year at SCAA and I've been working closely with them ever since. <br> <br>Lap didn't just improve my game immensely but he also gave me opportunities outside of playing basketball and that's what excites me about the start of Athletify. What we're trying to do is something special for the youths! We want to give athletes the same guidance and the same athletic development we had that elevated us towards success.</p>

        <h3>"We're here to prepare you for every opportunity, basketball-related or not"</h3>
        <p>I've been submerged in my love for sports ever since I started playing rugby and basketball at the age of 10. Presently, that very same love has guided me to the position I'm in today. Over the years, I have witnessed how something as simple as an opportunity had allowed my friends to realize their talents and potential, and now we're here together providing those very same opportunities to others. <br> <br> That's what excites us about Athletify because it's more than a basketball development agency. What we're going to do is guide the youths and athletes of today to become the athletes and mentors of tomorrow. We possess a deep understanding that athletes are beyond the games they play, which is why the heart of our company is beyond providing quality training and development. We're here to prepare you for every opportunity, basketball-related or not.</p>

        <h3>"A combination of these virtues + opportunity is all success takes."</h3>
        <p>This game has taken me many places around the world, playing professionally overseas for 10 years has introduced me to different styles of basketball. My experiences have made me the player and coach I am today, where my ultimate goal is to teach everyone the importance of hard work, dedication, and self-discipline - because a combination of these virtues + opportunity is all success takes. <br> <br> That's why Athletify is a one-stop destination for ANY basketball player. We teach virtues & provide opportunities that are applicable beyond the game.  </p>

        <p>I played my collegiate years of basketball at Auburn University as a 4-year starter. I then went on to play overseas professionally for 10 seasons. Some places I have spent time playing in are Germany, Argentina, and Japan to name a few. I have been known for my hard work and tenacity in how I approach the game, I call it "THE DAWG MENTALITY!". I have now focused my attention on using my wisdom and knowledge of being a top Athlete to help others use the gift of training to guide them to reach levels in basketball and in life that require a different mindset.</p>
